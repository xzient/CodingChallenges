# Pipe Flow Challege

This problem consists of having four times in a rectangular grid:

*   **Source:** which consist of starting flow.
*   **Sinks:** defined by uppercase letters. 
*   **Pipes:** Where the flow goes to.
*   **None:** These are empty slots that do not conduct the flow.

The goal is to find all sinks where the flow passes through.

-----

To simplify this, the entire code is within a single functions that itself has two embedded functions. 

The output sorted string with all the sink names where the flow goes through.
